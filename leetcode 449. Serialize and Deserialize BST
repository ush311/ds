449. Serialize and Deserialize BST
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

Sol:
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null){
            return "#";
        }
        return String.valueOf(root.val) + "," + serialize(root.left) + "," + serialize(root.right);
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        String[]strs = data.split(",");
        return deserialize(strs, new int[]{0});
    }
    private TreeNode deserialize(String[]arr, int[]idx){
        if(arr[idx[0]].equals("#")){
            idx[0]++;
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(arr[idx[0]++]));
        root.left = deserialize(arr, idx);
        root.right = deserialize(arr, idx);
        return root;
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
